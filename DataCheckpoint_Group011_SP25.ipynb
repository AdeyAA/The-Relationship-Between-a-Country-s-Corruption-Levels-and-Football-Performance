    "To what extent does political corruption–defined as the abuse of power for private gain and measured by Corruption Perceptions Index and Press Freedom Index–impact the long-term performance of national football teams in international tournaments as measured by FIFA World Rankings progression over years? Furthermore, how does institutional strength correlate with sustained competitive success when accounting for economic factors like GDP per capita?"

    "The participation of a national team in international competitions evoke a sense of unity and national pride among its citizens. As one of the most widely followed global sports with audiences in the billions,<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) football serves as a prominent platform through which these sentiments are reinforced and expressed. Major tournaments such as FIFA World Cup and regional tournaments like the UEFA European Championship or the Copa America become a major platform for nations to broadcast their athletic capacities, reaffirm their collective identity and establish their international standing. On the world stage, international and national reputation is at stake, making football more of a symbolic representation of a country’s strength. Given the symbolic weight that international football carries, it is no surprise that governments invest heavily in football for reputation’s sake. In our analysis we hope to explore how corruption perceptions–determined by Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), press freedom index (PFI)–may impact football performance outcomes like the FIFA World rankings and World Cup appearances. We will use Press Freedom Index to measure social factors, Corruption Perception index to measure political factors, and a global dataset of GDP per capita to measure economic factors against FIFA world rankings to measure national team strength.\n",

    "A recent analysis done by The University of Chicago Press Journal, introduces the term sportswashing.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Sportswashing is the process by which countries use sports-especially international events-to improve negative public perceptions often associated with a government’s abuses of human rights. In their case study of Qatar hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, they sought to find the viability of sportswashing. Their research suggests that hosting events such as the world cup “led to a more favorable view of the Arab world” but did little to directly improve Qatar’s image. This research is highly relevant to our research as it highlights the political motivations behind a country’s involvement in sports. Similarly a report done by the Human Rights Foundation, delves into the mechanisms through which authoritarian regimes utilize international sports to improve reputation and divert attention from negative press.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",

Our research hopes to build upon these findings to see how factors such as funding intersect with corruption and performance success.\n",
    "While these reports provide valuable insight of the use of “sportswashing” by autocratic regimes, neither explicitly test the whether the corruption level of a country directly translates to a better overall performance in international football. Prior work informs the political context of our study but does not directly address our question: does political corruption influence the development of national football teams\n",

    "We hypothesize that countries with higher levels of political corruption–lower CPI score and smaller PFI score– can have a very high international football performance to improve their image. Countries with low corruption levels show consistent success or improvement over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize this trend for countries with high levels of corruption to allocate their minimal funds (measured by GDP) to their entertainment sector rather than towards the improvement of the public sector and current national welfare. We believe this is true because, as sportswashing suggests, governments use high-profile entertainment events to divert public attention away from human rights abuses. Countries with lower corruption can maintain a steady rank because they have the ability to consistently fund their national football teams."

    "- In the data that we have proposed, we will be using data directly from FIFA for some of the data. Getting data directly from the source of what we are trying to analyze, I believe, will make our data more reliable. We might have to look into where exactly the data we use from Wikipedia for the World Cup performance is directly coming from. Because data from Wikipedia can be edited, that is something we are going to have to consider; we could potentially get that data from a different avenue. \n",
    "- In order to make sure that our data doesn’t contain any bias, or to make sure there aren't any ethical concerns. We will make sure that all website and data files we upload into our project have credibility. This includes making sure that the data was not potentially edited by anyone, as well as making sure the publishers of the data are credible sources within the field we are interested in exploring the data from. To the best of our ability, we can also get data directly from sources, such as the FIFA World Cup website and as well as government official websites, to get data about corruption statistics within countries. We can also make sure to use multiple different sources and cross-reference data to make sure that everything aligns correctly. In the process of analyzing the data, we will also make it clear about the limitations that we encountered when trying to collect data, if any."
