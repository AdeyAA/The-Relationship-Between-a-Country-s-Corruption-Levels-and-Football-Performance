    "Football, as a globally followed sport, plays a powerful role in shaping national identity and international reputation. Governments, especially those with high levels of corruption, often invest in football to boost their image with a practice known as sportswashing. This study explores how political corruption and institutional strength influence national football performance over time. By examining FIFA rankings alongside corruption and economic indicators, we assess whether sports investment serves as a tool for image management in highly corrupt states. We hypothesize that in countries with high levels of corruption, limited financial resources (as indicated by GDP) are more likely to be directed toward the entertainment sector, particularly sports, rather than toward improving public services or overall national welfare. This aligns with the concept of sportswashing, where governments invest in major sporting events to distract from human rights violations and systemic issues. In contrast, countries with lower corruption levels can maintain consistent performance in international football rankings due to their ability to sustainably invest in their national teams. "

    "The participation of a national team in international competitions evoke a sense of unity and national pride among its citizens. As one of the most widely followed global sports with audiences in the billions,<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) football serves as a prominent platform through which these sentiments are reinforced and expressed. Major tournaments such as FIFA World Cup and regional tournaments like the UEFA European Championship or the Copa America become a major platform for nations to broadcast their athletic capacities, reaffirm their collective identity and establish their international standing. On the world stage, international and national reputation is at stake, making football more of a symbolic representation of a country’s strength. Given the symbolic weight that international football carries, it is no surprise that governments invest heavily in football for reputation’s sake. In our analysis we hope to explore how corruption perceptions–determined by Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), press freedom index (PFI)–may impact football performance outcomes like the FIFA World rankings and World Cup appearances. We will use Press Freedom Index to measure social factors, Corruption Perception index to measure political factors, and a global dataset of GDP per capita to measure economic factors against FIFA world rankings to measure national team strength.\n",

    "A recent analysis done by The University of Chicago Press Journal, introduces the term sportswashing.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Sportswashing is the process by which countries use sports-especially international events-to improve negative public perceptions often associated with a government’s abuses of human rights. In their case study of Qatar hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, they sought to find the viability of sportswashing. Their research suggests that hosting events such as the world cup “led to a more favorable view of the Arab world” but did little to directly improve Qatar’s image. This research is highly relevant to our research as it highlights the political motivations behind a country’s involvement in sports. Similarly a report done by the Human Rights Foundation, delves into the mechanisms through which authoritarian regimes utilize international sports to improve reputation and divert attention from negative press.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",

    "A recent empirical study published investigated the correlation between funding and performance success among European football clubs. This paper analyzed 59 European football companies over the 2013-2018 time span and found a significant positive correlation between financial performance and the success of the club.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) This provides valuable insight into the influence finance has on sport performance. Our research hopes to build upon these findings to see how factors such as funding intersect with corruption and performance success.\n",
    "While these reports provide valuable insight of the use of “sportswashing” by autocratic regimes, neither explicitly test the whether the corruption level of a country directly translates to a better overall performance in international football. Prior work informs the political context of our study but does not directly address our question: does political corruption influence the development of national football teams\n",

    "We hypothesize that countries with higher levels of political corruption–lower CPI score and smaller PFI score– can have a very high international football performance to improve their image. Countries with low corruption levels show consistent success or improvement over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize this trend for countries with high levels of corruption to allocate their minimal funds (measured by GDP) to their entertainment sector rather than towards the improvement of the public sector and current national welfare. We believe this is true because, as sportswashing suggests, governments use high-profile entertainment events to divert public attention away from human rights abuses. Countries with lower corruption can maintain a steady rank because they have the ability to consistently fund their national football teams."

    "The purpose of this was to further analyze and check that GDP does not influence the FIFA ranking of a country. We wanted to confirm that GDP was not a confounding variable in the relationship of corruption and FIFA ranking. The linear regression analysis verifies that GDP is not a confounding variable. However analyzing the top and bottom 25 countries in GDP and calculating their average CPI scores, we can identify that gdp has some sort of role in the relationship but requires deeper analysis."

    "# Discusison and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project we explored whether political corruption influences the success and performance of national football teams. We used the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) and Press Freedom Index (PFI) to evaluate the level of political corruption for each country in relation to FIFA world rankings over the years 2012 to 2023. GDP per capita contextualized the economic capacity of each country and allowed us to explore the relationship between economic capabilities, corruption, and football performance. The broader intention of the project is to determine whether there was statistical evidence that governments use sports, football specifically, as a form of “sportswashing” to deflect away from criticisms from an international audience of potential human rights violations. In our background research we built upon previous studies that did case studies examining how authoritarian regimes used sports to improve their political image. In our report we expanded upon this research to explore a general relationship between corruption indicators and football performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon further analysis we found that our findings support our hypothesis that countries with high corruption scores had relatively high success in international football. When we took the linear regression analysis between FIFA rankings and CPI we found that there was very strong statistical evidence of a relationship between these two variables. We can then say that there is a statistically significant relationship between the Corruption Perception Index and FIFA Rankings. This reinforces the conclusions we drew from our graphs that show a moderate negative correlation between the two variables. In general terms, the more corrupt (lower CPI score) a country is the higher the FIFA rank average. Building upon this analysis, we took these results and controlled for the Press Freedom Index (PFI), another tell for the level of corruption. The statistically significant relationship between FIFA rank and CPI disappeared which we owe to a multicollinear relationship between PFI and CPI. We can therefore conclude that both CPI and PFI have a statistically significant relationship with FIFA ranks. We can deduce that the corruption of a country correlates with their FIFA rank. Even further we can infer from the scatter matrix that there is evidence that the more corrupt a country is the more successful they are in football competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reinforce the statistical significance and findings of relationships between our variables we applied the same method for GDP. When we controlled for GDP we found that there is still significant evidence of a relationship between CPI and FIFA ranking. This means that GDP is not a predictor for FIFA Ranking and not a confounding variable for the relationship between CPI and FIFA Ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of limitations that we came across in our project were the variance of the country names in our datasets. Some datasets had countries with different names, but they were the same country. When we merged all of our data, those countries were dropped. Dropping these countries could be a possible limitation of our analysis, because it could skew our results, due to the data from those countries being missing. Another limitation is the oversimplification of CPI and PFI, there is no way that we could know whether the corruption reported by these countries completely represents the societal and economic conditions in these countries. Another limitation is that using only FIFA rankings does not necessarily completely reflect the strength of the football team in each country. A country's team can also be measured by other things, like their performance in other tournaments, like the COPA. So, only using FIFA rankings as the representation of a country's football team can be a limitation. \n",
    "Tying in previous studies on this subject we claimed that our experiment would directly answer whether political corruption influences the development of national football teams. Our findings provide statistical support for the case study on sportswashing discussed by Reiche (2023), concluding that events like Qatar’s hosting of the World Cup improved international perceptions in the short-term. The most important aspect of this research towards our project is the suggestion of sports as a means to improve perceptions and national pride. Similarly, the Human Rights Foundation expanded upon this idea, outlining how authoritarian regimes use sports to distract from human rights violations. Our analysis points to a broader and more long-term pattern in football performance among politically corrupt nations. Our data has shown that this pattern exists and not only supports these case studies but allows us to generalize the results and conclusions of previous studies across a larger sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our research suggests that political corruption correlates with international football success. The results confirm our hypothesis of a correlation between corruption and football performance. While economic power does play a role, it is unclear the exact influence it has on the relationship and opens a new pathway to investigate. This contributes to the understanding of sports as a mechanism which countries can use to showcase their strength and as a way to manipulate political image. \n",
