## The Relationship Between a Country's Corruption Levels and Football Performance

Football, as a globally followed sport, plays a powerful role in shaping national identity and international reputation. Governments, especially those with high levels of corruption, often invest in football to boost their image with a practice known as sportswashing. This study explores how political corruption and institutional strength influence national football performance over time. By examining FIFA rankings alongside corruption and economic indicators, we assess whether sports investment serves as a tool for image management in highly corrupt states. We hypothesize that in countries with high levels of corruption, limited financial resources (as indicated by GDP) are more likely to be directed toward the entertainment sector, particularly sports, rather than toward improving public services or overall national welfare. This aligns with the concept of sportswashing, where governments invest in major sporting events to distract from human rights violations and systemic issues. In contrast, countries with lower corruption levels can maintain consistent performance in international football rankings due to their ability to sustainably invest in their national teams.
