    "The participation of a national team in international competitions evoke a sense of unity and national pride among its citizens. As one of the most widely followed global sports with audiences in the billions,<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) football serves as a prominent platform through which these sentiments are reinforced and expressed. Major tournaments such as FIFA World Cup and regional tournaments like the UEFA European Championship or the Copa America become a major platform for nations to broadcast their athletic capacities, reaffirm their collective identity and establish their international standing. On the world stage, international and national reputation is at stake, making football more of a symbolic representation of a country’s strength. Given the symbolic weight that international football carries, it is no surprise that governments invest heavily in football for reputation’s sake. In our analysis we hope to explore how corruption perceptions–determined by Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), press freedom index (PFI)–may impact football performance outcomes like the FIFA World rankings and World Cup appearances. We will use Press Freedom Index to measure social factors, Corruption Perception index to measure political factors, and a global dataset of GDP per capita to measure economic factors against FIFA world rankings to measure national team strength.\n",

    "A recent analysis done by The University of Chicago Press Journal, introduces the term sportswashing.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Sportswashing is the process by which countries use sports-especially international events-to improve negative public perceptions often associated with a government’s abuses of human rights. In their case study of Qatar hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, they sought to find the viability of sportswashing. Their research suggests that hosting events such as the world cup “led to a more favorable view of the Arab world” but did little to directly improve Qatar’s image. This research is highly relevant to our research as it highlights the political motivations behind a country’s involvement in sports. Similarly a report done by the Human Rights Foundation, delves into the mechanisms through which authoritarian regimes utilize international sports to improve reputation and divert attention from negative press.<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3)\n",

Our research hopes to build upon these findings to see how factors such as funding intersect with corruption and performance success.\n",
    "While these reports provide valuable insight of the use of “sportswashing” by autocratic regimes, neither explicitly test the whether the corruption level of a country directly translates to a better overall performance in international football. Prior work informs the political context of our study but does not directly address our question: does political corruption influence the development of national football teams\n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that countries with higher levels of political corruption–lower CPI score and smaller PFI score– can have a very high international football performance to improve their image. Countries with low corruption levels show consistent success or improvement over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize this trend for countries with high levels of corruption to allocate their minimal funds (measured by GDP) to their entertainment sector rather than towards the improvement of the public sector and current national welfare. We believe this is true because, as sportswashing suggests, governments use high-profile entertainment events to divert public attention away from human rights abuses. Countries with lower corruption can maintain a steady rank because they have the ability to consistently fund their national football teams."

CPI values are very similar as their scores range from 0-25. The one corruption data set that tends to change at a high rate is Fifa rankings. For example, Haiti corruption values reach as low as 40, but reach as high as 100+. Overall between the 5 countries, PFI is poor across all five countries, with Turkmenistan and Sudan among the worst. Fifa rankings are unstable but less correlated with the other values. CPI scores generally show little improvements but remain low, showing corruption. GDP values are low and stagnant in all countries, pointing to limited economic development."

Their corruption levels are also very low as the CPI scores remain high, indicating trustworthy governments. GDP reflects economic strength, generally increased or remained stable, especially in recent years. For FIFA rankings, all countries performed fairly well, with some like Denmark and Norway improving significantly after 2014. Compared to countries like Afghanistan, Haiti, Libya, Sudan, and Turkmenistan , this group shows much stronger performance overall such as better media, less corruption, better economies, and similar or better FIFA rankings.

    "For our project, we plan to use data directly from FIFA, which should make our information more trustworthy since it's from the main organization we're studying. However, for things like World Cup performance stats from Wikipedia, we know that Wikipedia can be edited by anyone, so we need to be careful. We’ll try to find where that data originally came from and consider using more official sources instead. When it comes to data about corruption in different countries. Some countries might report lower corruption levels to make themselves look better. For that reason, we’ll try to use independent and trusted organizations, like Transparency International, rather than just government websites. We’ll also be clear about where the data comes from and what the possible problems with it are. Even if we use good sources, our data might still have bias. For example, if we only include countries that have complete data and leave out others, we could end up with an unfair picture, which would be selection bias. It could lead to people wrongly thinking that certain countries are worse or more corrupt just because of how the data was collected. To prevent that, we’ll try to include as many countries as possible, explain any gaps in our data, and remind people that correlation doesn’t mean one thing causes another. If our project becomes popular or widely shared, there’s a risk that people might misunderstand or misuse our findings. To prevent that, we’ll make sure to include clear explanations of what our data does and does not show. We’ll also add disclaimers to help people use our findings responsibly and not jump to unfair conclusions."
